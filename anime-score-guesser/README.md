# MAL score guesser

React javascript project where users guess an anime's MAL score and popularity ranking based off a youtube video of that anime.
Current site is up at: mal-score-guesser-32yf8z55g-jonathan-ami.vercel.app
The site is limited to a certain number of API calls so it might be down at the time of running.

# APIs
Youtube Data V3
Anime DB from rapid api
Jikan API

Ensure that you obtain keys and store them in a .env in the root of the project. 
Each key should contain "REACT_APP_" (Eg. "REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY"). 


# Future changes

- Change the react-player so that it only plays a clip of the entire video
- Implmenent a better scoring system with more visual feedback
